In this p5js experiment, I used the "flocking" example as my base. I then made the background color white, changed the initial direction that the flock heads in/towards, and also reduced the speed that they "fly" at! Before, the flock was essentially exploding downwards off the start, so I attemped to turn that around.



<style>
    body, html {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        overflow: hidden;
    }

    iframe {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 0;
    }
</style>
