In this p5js experiment, I used the "particles" example as my base. I then played around by changing the speed, the color of the particles, and the lines connecting them together. The speed changed from slow to fast, the color from pink to white, and the lines from being very faint to solid.




<style>
    body, html {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        overflow: hidden;
    }

    iframe {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 0;
    }
</style>
