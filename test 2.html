In this p5js experiment, I used the "bounce" example as my base. I then changed up the speed the ball goes at, the color of the background to pure black, and the frame rate of the ball to 10 from 30. In addition to this, I made the ball only be able to bounce horizontally and not vertically. The result interested me and is a weird spin off of the traditional corner hitting bouncing ball video.



<style>
    body, html {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        overflow: hidden;
    }

    iframe {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        border: 0;
    }
</style>
